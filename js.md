  // use while loop is where terminating values is not known 
  // use for loop is where terminating values is known
  // use do while loop is where we should run program is atleast one times 


// function 
Q1 differece  between parameter and argument (home work)
 ans-- a parameter is a variable defined in a function or method, while an argument is the value passed to that function or method when it is called

// dom--- document object model
  when we need to change in html and css using js then we will use dom.
 . dom  divide html page in tree like structure
 . element called node
 . text between element is text node.

 // we need to target node in js using using   
 1.id 
 2.class name 
 3.tag name
 . getElementById-- select only one node
 . getElementsByClass-- store node list  in array form 

 . innerHTML -- change contant and apply element also
 . textcontant --- change contanta not use tags 
.home work --- 
Q1. what is hoisting
  In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior in which variable declarations, function declarations, and certain other constructs appear to be "moved" to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.

However, it's important to note that only declarations are hoisted, not initializations. 

 or   

   Hoisting in JavaScript is a built-in language behavior that moves variable, function, and class declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. This allows you to use these declarations before they are declared in the code:
Q2. ws6 and ecma full form 
   .ws6 - web script 6 ( script 6 that is 6th eddition of ECMAScript)
  In the context of JavaScript, WS6 likely refers to ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based.

  Hereâ€™s a breakdown:


  .  ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

  . ECMA -- European Computer Manufacturers Association

  - ECMA is an international standards organization responsible for developing and maintaining technical standards, including the specification for JavaScript, known as ECMAScript.
