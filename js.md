// dom--- document object model
  when we need to change in html and css using js then we will use dom.
 . dom  divide html page in tree like structure
 . element called node
 . text between element is text node.

 // we need to target node in js using using   
 1.id 
 2.class name 
 3.tag name
 . getElementById-- select only one node
 . getElementsByClass-- store node list  in array form 

 . innerHTML -- change contant and apply tags also
 . textcontant --- change contant and not use tags 
.home work --- 
Q1. what is hoisting
  Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

 or   

   Hoisting in JavaScript is a built-in language behavior that moves variable, function, and class declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. This allows you to use these declarations before they are declared in the code:
Q2. ws6 and ecma full form 
   .ws6 - web script 6 ( script 6 that is 6th eddition of ECMAScript)
  In the context of JavaScript, WS6 likely refers to ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based.

  Hereâ€™s a breakdown:


  .  ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

  . ECMA -- European Computer Manufacturers Association

  - ECMA is an international standards organization responsible for developing and maintaining technical standards, including the specification for JavaScript, known as ECMAScript.


// events---
      onclick="fun()" === on click here where we use event  we will move to fun() 
      // we can also use argument to use other method of function 
     ondblclick="fun()"===Double click
     onmouseenter="fun()"===Mous enter
     onmouseleave="fun()"====Leave mouse
     oncontextmenu="fun()"===== on right click

.queryselector - use css selecting properties
-- select first node only
-- use to select node where we will note have to use indexing 

// attritutes -- behaviour of tags or additional properties

// 23rd jan 2025
.Array--- it is a collection of multiple type of data in javascript . 
. it is denoted by square bracket
. it is in on ordered (indexing-- positinig of data)
. for of loop - take one by one element from array.


// some array function are --
1. push-- insert data at last position of array 
2. pop- remove data from last position of array
3. unshift - insert data at first position of array 
4. shift- delete data from first position of array
5. slice- select data from the array at any position 
  -- take two argument 1. startin index(included) 2. last index(excluded) 
6. splice - use to insert or delete element inside the array at any position
  --- it take 3 argument if we have to add element -- 1. position (index where wanted to insert) ,2.no of element wanted to delete , 3. inserting element
  --- it take 2 argument if we have to delete -- 1. position (index where wanted to insert) ,2.no of element wanted to delete 
  --- we can perform both delete and insert together (use 3 argument)

  // Destructring of array -- access of data from element using variable at the place of indexing 

  // sprade(...) operator
